It was about the importance of failure in achieving success, a topic that still resonates with me today.\n\nBy the time the Wright brothers flew the world's first aircraft in 1903, they had failed countless times and faced numerous setbacks. They had built multiple unsuccessful models prior to creating a flight-worthy one. During these challenging times, they used every defeat to learn what worked and what did not, in order to build an incrementally better aircraft. The Wright brothers story is a concrete example of the best advice I received: failure is the first step toward success.\n\nAt first, this advice confused and surprised me since failure is rarely associated with success. However, after further reflection, I realized most people experienced setbacks while pursuing their dreams. Although they had different goals and failed differently, in the end, they all had one thing in common: resilience; they were able to overcome and learn from their mistakes.\n\nSetbacks caused by failure show us that we have pushed ourselves and reached far in our goals. There is no doubt that trivial goals are easily achieved, but such accomplishments are often of little value or importance. Conversely, failure is proof of our ambitions, that we have challenged ourselves and pushed our limits when we pursued lofty endeavors. When we try difficult things, we are bound to fail initially. However, knowing how to appreciate failure can provide us with some valuable lessons. It is resilience, the ability to recover and learn from our mistakes, that converts failure into a temporary setback. Learning what worked and what did not is a critical step toward success. When we show resilience and rebound from our failures, we are better prepared for our next attempt and ready to achieve success.\n\nThis advice has changed me forever by helping me embrace failure. It gives me the courage to pursue challenging goals, knowing that I will most likely experience setbacks along the way. Furthermore, it gives me confidence that with resilience and perseverance, I can accomplish these goals. Learning about failure helps me approach challenges with an open mindset and face them directly instead of avoiding them. Because of this I can push myself to do better and keep reaching farther.\n\nIf I could give someone a single piece of advice, this would be it. I would offer it in the hopes that it can inspire and change them, as it did me. It teaches that failure is part of the learning process, that it is a sign of a worthy endeavor, and that the way we handle failure is the most important predictor of success. Perhaps, in the end, the biggest failure is someone who has succeeded in everything they have tried.","src/content/blog/failure-a-first-step-to-success.mdx","8c5a9d0f2ef66960","failure-a-first-step-to-success.mdx",true,"hello-world",{"id":26,"data":28,"body":34,"filePath":35,"digest":36,"legacyId":37,"deferredRender":25},{"title":29,"date":30,"summary":31,"tags":32},"Hello, world","2025-12-13","A starting point for the blog — what I plan to write about, and how I think about building.",[33],"Update","This is the first post on my site.

These prototypes were each three inches thick and tested at collision speed of 6.82 mph. To test them, a pendulum-like device was created where an arm would swing and hit the prototype at a constant speed and force. Each design was also tested five times, with their averages being calculated. A Mass-Force Index (Prototype Mass x Max Force) and a Mass-Deceleration Index (Prototype Mass x Max Deceleration x -1) were created to compare designs. A lower output was favorable since it would indicate the design would be lightweight and cheap all while exhibiting good shock absorption properties. Furthermore, the prototype would have to prevent the testing arm from penetrating the prototype completely and yield an impact force and deceleration below 250 N and -245m/s (-25G) respectively.\n\nA series of prototypes were tested including a standard hexagon, zigzag, thin-hexagon and a combination of a zigzag and hexagon design. During the conclusion it was determined the standard hexagon was the most favorable with Indexes. However, this investigation proved that it is difficult to create a standard shock absorber optimized for every situation. Every situation is different with unique needs, the design that was proven optimal was only optimal based on the testing specifications put in place. Furthermore, a series of errors could have impacted on the results including print discrepancies and temperature & humidity impacting both the prototypes properties and the measuring devices.\n\n\u003Ciframe\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fq_6kPeij3g?si=z1b_Dk8Dscfkjema\"\n  title=\"YouTube video\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n  allowFullScreen\n  className=\"w-full aspect-video rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800\"\n/>\n\n## Research Methodology\n\nTo determine the optimal internal structure, thorough research was conducted on current infill patterns used in 3D printing, including honeycomb, grid, and other common geometries. The findings helped inform the design of custom infill patterns and aided in the creation of future iterations.\n\nIn order to test and evaluate each prototype, a pendulum-like testing device was constructed. Each prototype would be placed in a fixed location and the arm of the device would hit each prototype at a consistent speed. Sensors were attached to the arm to measure the force and deceleration upon impact. Each prototype was tested five times to ensure accuracy, and the average values were calculated for comparison. Furthermore all impacts were recorded using a high-speed camera to analyze the deformation and energy absorption characteristics of each design.\n\nLike stated earlier, two indexes were created to compare each design: the Mass-Force Index and the Mass-Deceleration Index. These indexes took into account both the mass of the prototype and the measured force and deceleration, providing a comprehensive metric for evaluating shock absorption performance relative to weight. Using these two indexes as well as fixed requirements for maximum force and deceleration, each design was compared and ranked accordingly.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nAfter testing 4 different infill patterns, it was determined that the standard hexagon design provided the best shock absorption properties based on the Mass-Force and Mass-Deceleration Indexes. This design effectively distributed the impact forces, resulting in lower peak forces and decelerations compared to other patterns tested. While a combined zigzag and hexagon design showed promise, it did not outperform the standard hexagon in this specific testing scenario, due to the higher costs assoicated due to increased material usage and print time.\n\n## Future Directions\n\nFuture work could explore additional infill patterns, variable impact speed, angle and materials. Furthermore attempting to create more unique infill patterns that are optimized for shock absorption could be beneficial.\n\nOverall this experiment provided valuable insights and learning opportunities into the field of 3D printing and shock absorption, as well as testing methodologies, design of experiments and data analysis techniques.","src/content/projects/3d-printing-shock-absorption.mdx","246dd26834c7a59a","3d-printing-shock-absorption.mdx","aircraft-cabin-redesign",{"id":53,"data":55,"body":61,"filePath":62,"digest":63,"legacyId":64,"deferredRender":25},{"title":56,"summary":57,"tags":58},"Aircraft Cabin Redesign","A recreational project, aiming to redesign aircraft cabin and airline seating for improved comfort and functionality, through 3D modeling.",[46,59,60],"CAD","Aviation","## Project Overview\n\nThis recreational design project focuses on reimagining aircraft cabins and seating through detailed 3D modeling, with the goal of enhancing passenger comfort, functionality, and spatial efficiency across multiple cabin classes.

This solution is purpose-built to address Pediatric Vehicular Heatstroke (PVH) by combining proven hardware, streamlined logic flows, and a resilient communication stack.\n\n\u003Ciframe\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mR1hxS20mqs\"\n  title=\"InfantGuard Video Presentation\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n  allowFullScreen\n  className=\"w-full aspect-video rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 dark:border-neutral-800\"\n/>\n\n## Background\n\nForgotten Baby Syndrome (FSD) is a primary driver of Pediatric Vehicular Heatstroke (PVH) deaths and injuries. Every year infants across the US die due to overheating in a vehicle after being left unsupervised. Since 1998 over 1000 infants have lost their lives due to PVH. That averages to about ~37 deaths per year. In most of these cases, guardians simply forgot their infants were still in the overheating vehicle. Since vehicles can heat up to 120F in as little as 30 minutes, being able to take action before it's too late becomes crucial. Infant deaths can occur as early as 109F. InfantGuard attempts to resolve this issue by creating a reliable and long-lasting monitoring system that detects a forgotten baby and notifies the parent. If temperatures reach deadly levels InfantGuard can automatically notify emergency services with the vehicle's details, temperature and location.\n\n## Features\n\n- ***Use of Bluetooth Fob:*** InfantGuard uses a Bluetooth device, in this case a BLE iBeacon attached to the car keys, to detect the parent's presence in the vehicle. This allows for Arduino to better know the current scenario and take more appropriate actions.\n- ***Text Notifications about forgotten infant:*** InfantGuard uses text notifications to alert the user if their infant is left unsupervised in the vehicle. If temperatures begin nearing dangerous levels, InfantGuard will text the parent in a dedicated alert, making sure to give the vehicle's current temperature. If temperatures reach deadly levels the user will be sent an emergency text, notifying them of the situation and that emergency services have been contacted. In all these texts the vehicle's location is always attached.\n- ***Emergency Services Alert:*** If vehicle temperatures reach deadly levels, InfantGuard will automatically text emergency services, including the vehicle make and model, temperature and location. This is to allow for a quick response that could help save the infant's life.\n- ***Manual Reset:*** If for some reason InfantGuard needs to be manually reset, a button present in the vehicle is available. Once pressed the system will stop monitoring for 15 minutes, before beginning scanning again.\n- ***Status Notifications:*** InfantGuard provides the parent with constant status notifications. When the system is manually deactivated, the parent will receive a confirmation text, before receiving another one when the system reactivates. Furthermore the parent can also be notified with other texts, like when the system first boots up and is connected.\n- ***Long Lasting Battery Life:*** InfantGuard is designed to have a long lasting battery, so that it can continue monitoring even if the vehicle is turned off. The current 10000mAh Belkin Battery Pack allows for roughly 80 hours of straight use. However the battery pack can recharge in roughly 4 hrs., so InfantGuard has been designed to recharge when the vehicle is turned on, and use battery when the vehicle is turned off.\n\n## Hardware\n\nInfantGuard's hardware and software provides reliable and long-lasting vehicle monitoring, ready to take action if necessary.\n\n### Sensors\n\n- 2 Force Sensing Resistors are attached to key locations where the child's back will be located. This ensures accurate detection of the infant at all times.\n- A DHT-22 Temperature sensor allows for accurate temperature detection which can trigger InfantGuard to take necessary actions to protect the infant.\n- An HM-10 Bluetooth Receiver scans for the desired device/devices that are used to consider the parent present. The HM-10 uses RSSI signal strength to determine whether the parent is present with infant or too far away, which could require attention.\n- An Arduino Push Button also allows for the system to be manually deactivated for 15 minutes at a time. During this period the Arduino will stop scanning and monitoring the vehicle.\n\n### Connectivity\n\nInfantGuard is powered by a Botletics SIM7000A shield. This allows for the Arduino to communicate with the internet, allowing for texts to be remotely sent via Twilio's API. The SIM7000A is powered by Holograms IoT SIM Card, allowing for cheap and reliable connection no matter the vehicle's location. Furthermore the SIM7000A also acts as the GPS of the system, allowing InfantGuard to easily be able to record the vehicle's location.\n\n### Microcontroller\n\nInfantGuard is powered by an Arduino Mega 2560, to allow for multiple active Hardware Serial ports. This allows for both the HM-10, SIM7000A to actively communicate and scan. Furthermore if the Arduino is plugged into a computer for debugging, the Serial Monitor can also be used simultaneously.\n\n### Exterior and FSR Docking\n\nInfantGuard is conveniently placed into a 3D printed case, that allows for all wires, microcontrollers and sensors to conveniently be hidden. Furthermore the box allows for a mounting location for the push button, temperature sensor and HM-10, so that they can get more accurate readings.\n\nTo allow for the car seat to easily be removed two docking components, 1 for each FSR sensor were created. A universal male and female component were created. This allows for two wire connectors to be slid in and for them to automatically connect, thanks to a funnel system when the car seat is reattached to its base. The universal male and female components can be modified with specific mounting brackets to fit the car's requirements. In this prototype, a more specific variant was created so that the two components could be mounted at the rear of the seat.\n\nBoth of these files can be found as STL files on Thingiverse at the following link: [https://www.thingiverse.com/psavvas/collections/43677561/things](https://www.thingiverse.com/psavvas/collections/43677561/things)\n\n\u003Cdiv style={{display: 'flex', gap: '12px', justifyContent: 'center', flexWrap: 'wrap'}}>\n  \u003Cimg src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edfd0030-a746-4da9-93bb-535f2fd2935c\" alt=\"InfantGuard Mountable FSR Docking Components 1\" style={{width: '320px', maxWidth: '100%'}} />\n  \u003Cimg src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33637767-4be1-48d4-a11b-8721f7af63bf\" alt=\"InfantGuard Mountable FSR Docking Components 2\" style={{width: '320px', maxWidth: '100%'}} />\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp align=\"center\">\u003Cstrong>Mountable InfantGuard FSR Docking Components\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cdiv style={{display: 'flex', gap: '12px', justifyContent: 'center', flexWrap: 'wrap'}}>\n  \u003Cimg src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b0f6c85-e666-4a14-8905-3b7371bfaaf1\" alt=\"InfantGuard Generic FSR Docking Components 1\" style={{width: '320px', maxWidth: '100%'}} />\n  \u003Cimg src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80aefcca-c5c2-435d-acca-245b43f3f05a\" alt=\"InfantGuard Generic FSR Docking Components 2\" style={{width: '320px', maxWidth: '100%'}} />\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cp align=\"center\">\u003Cstrong>Generic InfantGuard FSR Docking Components\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\n### Wiring\n\nInfantGuard's wiring uses generic Dupont Wires that can be either used on a breadboard and the Arduino or soldered onto a circuit if preferred.\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" alt=\"InfantGuard Circuit Schematic\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/470edf90-954b-477a-a258-aee44d707836\" />\n\u003Cp align=\"center\">\u003Cstrong>InfantGuard Circuit Schematic\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\n## Software\n\nInfantGuard is an open source project on GitHub. All coding files are publicly available on GitHub; to learn more about contributing, visit the *Contribute* section of this page. This project is made up of two major sections: the on-device code and the cloud code. These were coded in Arduino Sketch and JavaScript respectively.\n\n### General Overview\n\nThe following flow chart exhibits the general flow of InfantGuard across both on-device programs and cloud programs:\n\n\u003Cimg width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" alt=\"InfantGuard General Code Flow\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f1b2c82-039d-49e1-8833-9332df4062f9\" />\n\u003Cp align=\"center\">\u003Cstrong>InfantGuard General Code Flow\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\n### Text Notification Workflow\n\n1. SIM7000A establishes connection with local cellular towers via a Hologram SIM.\n2. The SIM7000A then establishes a connection with a specific webhook.site URL that includes all the required information including vehicle location and temperature\n3. webhook.site then redirects the data received to a secure Cloudflare Worker.\n4. The Cloudflare Worker parses the data received and determines which message to send.\n5. Cloudflare fills the chosen message template with received variables before sending it to Twilio's API\n6. Twilio then takes charge of the SMS delivery to the user's phone.\n\n### On-Device Code\n\nOn-device code of InfantGuard, being coded mostly in Arduino Sketch has the majority of its code repeating itself in `void loop()`. The `void setup()` function is responsible for booting up the system, activating the sensors, establishing cellular and GPS connection as well as enabling the Bluetooth scanning. Inside `void loop()`, the program will always begin by checking the FSR sensor for an infant. If an infant is present then by precaution InfantGuard will record GPS location. InfantGuard will then scan for nearby Bluetooth devices using the MAC Address of the parent device and the RSSI signal strength value. InfantGuard uses this information to check whether the parent is present or not and also checks the temperature. Depending on these results, InfantGuard will determine whether it needs to send a text, and whether the text cooldown period has elapsed. If so it uses its cellular capabilities to communicate with the webhook.site\n\n### Off-Device Code\n\n***Webhook.site:***\nSince the SIM7000A can only establish an HTTP connection, websites that don't require a secure connection were needed. A custom webhook.site was then created which allowed for the Arduino to communicate with the webhook, have the webhook parse the data, and create a custom action that redirects the information to a secure Cloudflare Worker. The webhook uses an HTTP redirect action that forwards to the Cloudflare Worker. The action uses a 'GET' method with the following programmable URL: \n```\nhttps://workerURLgoeshere.workers.dev/?cord1=$request.query.cord1$&cord2=$request.query.cord2$&temp=$request.query.temp$&type=$request.query.type$\n```\n\n***Cloudflare Worker:***\nOnce webhook.site relays the information to the Cloudflare Worker, it parses the URL data and determines which text message template to send. It then fills out the variables in the message template like temperature or vehicle location and securely communicates with the Twilio API. Twilio is the text message provider that was chosen to securely provide text notifications to the user's phone. The full Cloudflare worker code can be found in the file: `Cloudflare.js` This workflow also helps protect the API keys which can be stored as secret variables inside the Cloudflare Worker dashboard.\n\n## Full Parts List\n\n- Arduino Mega 2560\n- FSR Force Resistance Sensor\n- Temperature Sensor\n- HM-10 Bluetooth Module\n- iBeacon Transmitter\n- Breadboard\n- Dupont Wires\n- 3.7V LiPo Battery\n- 10000 mAh Belkin Battery Pack\n- PLA Filament\n- 10K Ω & 2K Ω Resistor\n- Type C to USB D Adapter\n- Push Button\n- Circuit Board\n- Circuit Board Mounts\n- Male & Female 12v DC Power Jack Adapter Connector\n- Screws & Nuts\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you're interested in contributing feel free to fork the repository and submit a Pull Request.
