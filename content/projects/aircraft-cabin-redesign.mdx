## Project Overview

This recreational design project focuses on reimagining aircraft cabins and seating through detailed 3D modeling, with the goal of enhancing passenger comfort, functionality, and spatial efficiency across multiple cabin classes. The project includes five distinct concepts: a refined Premium Economy layout, a modernized Business Class, a luxurious First Class, an exclusive Three-Room First Class Suite, and a Sleeper Economy Cabin designed to make long-haul travel more restful and accessible for economy passengers.

Each cabin concept is tailored to the needs of its intended passenger segment, balancing innovation with practical considerations like space constraints, aircraft architecture, and operational efficiency. From modular privacy-focused suites to space-saving lie-flat designs and convertible sleeping arrangements, the project challenges the traditional boundaries of airline seating. Though conceptual, these designs aim to inspire future developments in aviation interior design by prioritizing user experience, comfort, and creative use of space.
