This website ([www.paulsavvas.me](http://www.paulsavvas.me/)) is changing domains. Starting May 1st, 2026 it will be using it's new domain [www.paulsavvas.com](http://www.paulsavvas.com/). The following posts explains what is happening and what action must be taken for a seamless transition. If you're already on the new site no action needs to be taken.

## What’s happening?

Starting May 1st, 2026 my personal portfolio will be moving from [www.paulsavvas.me](http://www.paulsavvas.me) to www.paulsavvas.com. To allow for a seamless transition, paulsavvas.me will remain in operation for the next few months. During the domain migration, I’ll continue to post information on both sites about the domain migration.

Please note that starting May 1st, 2026 while [www.paulsavvas.me](http://www.paulsavvas.me) will still be active, it will no longer be updated. Users are recommended to begin using the new domain as soon as it becomes available. Furthermore any old contact email that ended with the domain @paulsavvas.me (ex. [hello@paulsavvas.me](mailto:hello@paulsavvas.me)) will be terminated by September 1st, 2026. All emails will change to the new domain @paulsavvas.com and their prefix will remain the same. For instance hello@paulsavvas.me will become hello@paulsavvas.com

## What do I need to do?

Nothing. As the transition date approaches banners will be posted on [www.paulsavvas.me](http://www.paulsavvas.me) to direct traffic to my new site [www.paulsavvas.com](http://www.paulsavvas.com). After July 1st, 2026 content on the old website will no longer be available and www.paulsavvas.me will be used to redirect traffic to my new site. Information listing my old website or contact info will be progressively updates from May 1st, 2026 until July 1st, 2026. Please make sure to update your contact info. Emails will stay the same except .me will become .com

## Why switch domains?

Currently, I’m leasing my domain through Namecheap. I originally began my lease with Namecheap as [www.paulsavvas.me](http://www.paulsavvas.me) since they were offering a free year for any student wanting a .me domain. After renewing the domain, I’ve made the decision to migrate website to a more memorial domain. Furthermore, I’m using this opportunity to transfer domain registrar. Currently my website and many other public projects are being hosted through Vercel. Unlike Namecheap, Vercel’s business is not selling domain’s but instead hosting services. Therefore, they offer better domain rates and customer benefits. 

## Migration timeline

**April 1st, 2026 - Decision Finalization**

Decision will be finalized whether domain will be switched to www.paulsavvas.com. If for any reason migration is halted or postponed, I’ll will post such update on the [www.paulsavvas.me](http://www.paulsavvas.me) blog.

**May 1st, 2026 - Activation of new website**

My new site [www.paulsavvas.com](http://www.paulsavvas.com) will go live. It will feature the same content, UI and layout. Starting May 1st, 2026 my previous website’s content will remain publicly available but no longer be updated. The new emails @paulsavvas.com will become public and be actively monitored.

**May 1st - June 30, 2026 - Update of website and email mentions**

Content across my different accounts and public profiles will be updated to feature my new website. For instance old profiles still showing my old site or email will be updated.

**July 1st, 2026 - End content access for old site**

On July 1st, 2026 content on my old site [www.paulsavvas.me](http://www.paulsavvas.me) will no longer be available. The old site will be used as a redirect site informing oncoming traffic that I have switched domains and where they can find my new site.

**September 1st, 2026 - Termination of old email domain**

Emails using my old domain @paulsavvas.me will not longer be monitored and terminated. The new emails will follow the exact same format except they will switch from @paulsavvas.me to @paulsavvas.com

**November 1st, 2026 - Parking of old website**

On November 1, 2026 [paulsavvas.me](http://paulsavvas.me) will be parked. This means that the website will no longer be active and will no longer be able to be accessed. The URL will no longer be valid. This is to prepare for the end of the domain lease with Namecheap.

**December 11th, 2026 - End of migration**

My lease with Namecheap for [www.paulsavvas.me](http://www.paulsavvas.me) will end on December 11, 2026 marking the end of the transition to my new domain www.paulsavvas.com
